## 🔗 Data Modeling Approach

### Table Joins
Used joins to combine call-level data with agent-level attributes where necessary.

### Relationships
Implemented Tableau relationships to preserve granularity and ensure accurate aggregations across KPIs.

## 📐 Advanced Visual Techniques

### Spider / Radar Charts
Custom spider charts were created to compare agent performance across multiple dimensions such as resolution rate and speed of answer.
